# Prioritize Lockers

Network of parcel lockers. These parcel lockers are used by users to ship items.

The standard shipment flow for our parcel lockers is as follows:

- Seller of a pre-loved item drops off their parcel at a locker;
- Driver picks up the parcel from the origin locker & brings it to a warehouse;
- Parcels are sorted in the warehouse;
- Driver picks up the parcel from the warehouse & drops it off at the destination locker;
- Buyer of a pre-loved item picks up the parcel from the destination locker.
  
Every day, we must decide which lockers to visit. This decision involves a **trade-off between conflicting business objectives**. 
Visiting more lockers increases delivery speed, but it also increases delivery costs.
